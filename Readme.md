## Introduction 
This project was to explore the power of the Python libraries StatsModels. StatsModels focuses more on the technical and mathematical processes of machine learning, less focus on just predicting outcomes such as a library like SkLearn.
Exploring whether Purchase Power Parity holds between USD and AUD between 1986 and 2018. This script is an example of more in depth linear regression techniques used for time series analysis.   

## Technologies
Project was created with Python 3.7, libraries include:
*Pandas
*StatsModels
*Matplotlib


## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using npm:
